Command privilege / disabled

Figure out how to put commands on cooldown so they aren't spammed too much. Different commands should have
	differing cooldowns based on their use cases and functionality.

Announce when someone subs, follows, twitchprimes, resubs, w/e

~~COMMANDS~~
>USER COMMANDS<
!Bonk
-increments number of bonks, then says how many times (that user?) has bonked in chat.
-number in text file?
-web service?

!Schedule
-Toonborg reports the schedule as written by strimmer or a mod using the !UpdateSchedule command.

!Giveaway
-Enters a user into the current giveaway. If a user enters this command more than once during the giveaway
	period, they will be disqualified.
-When a user enters once, add them to a table with the value true, if they use the command and are already in
	the table, set that value to false.
-If there is no active giveaway, let the user know.

>MOD COMMANDS< (context.mod();)
!DisableCommand (Command)
-adds target command to a "Disabled Commands" set and removes it from the enabled commands set.
-Toonborg should verify in chat that the command has successfully been disabled.
-When a disabled command is used, toonborg should always say that it is disabled if it is used, then
	not run the command.
-Ensure that an unrecognized command isn't reported as disabled.
-Only general user commands should be disableable. If the target command is a mod command, report that
	mod commands cannot be disabled.

!EnableCommand (Command)
-adds target command to the "Enabled Commands" set and removes it from the disabled commands set.
-Toonborg should verify in chat that the command has successfully been enabled.
-Only general user commands should be enableable. If the target comand is a mod command, report that
	mod commands are always enabled.

!DisableAll
-Disables all enabled user commands.


!Initialize
-Enables and Disables commands as necessary to "reset" the available commands to normal. Most likely all
	user commands will be available, so this will just turn them all on, but in the case that some
	commands are under construction, this will make sure those commands are disabled.
-This command will check an "under construction" set to see which commands to leave disabled. The
	list of under construction mods will have to be updated by the developer working on them to ensure
	nothing breaks.

!UpdateSchedule (Schedule)
-Allows a mod to change what the !Schedule command will say when used.


!StartGiveaway
-Starts a giveaway, enabling users to enter for a chance to win a prize.
-Initializes an empty map and saves users who enter the !Giveaway command with a value of true if they enter
	once, or false if they enter more than once.
-If there is already a giveaway going, lets the strimmer know.

!EndGiveaway
-Ends the current giveaway period, saving the table.
-If there is no active giveaway, lets the strimmer know.

!PickRandomWinner
-
